# About This Project

I built Stockpile Gaming for my Media Communications Certificate. The instructions were to build a blog or something similar in a couple of weeks and use social media accounts to direct people to the website. The instructor suggested a website like Word Press, but I wanted to use my skills as a Web Developer to build something myself and to learn React and a CMS.

This was my first React project, and also my first time using Tailwind CSS and a CMS, and I chose Sanity.io. I spent a long time figuring out how I wanted the home page and navbar to look, and I wanted a minimal UI.

Looking back on the project I would have done a lot different, especially the homepage. I like the mostly empty home page with the uncentered logo, but I think the website would be much more usable and a better portfolio piece if it had content like recent articles on the page.

The articles page of this app was also a challenge. I also have a reviews section all set up that looks similar, and I wanted the images for both to be around the aspect ratio of a video game box, while showing more information to the side. I debated between having this and using a responsive grid layout to make more use of the space, but I looked at how other websites like IGN had their lists done at the time and I took inspiration from that.

The article page was something that took a long time as well. For a long time I was using a glassmorphic-inspired design, but I decided I wanted something a bit cleaner and that looked better on all devices, so I rewrote it and went with the current design: a full-width banner based on the article image with the page information, and a centered narrower section for the actual article.

Figuring out how to style the Rich Text was the largest hurdle by far, but I managed to work around it decently. I have learned how to more efficiently style these sections now, but what is here works.

Another feature I added to these pages was social media sharing. I wanted this to be an option because if I was going to commit to doing this after the class ended (I didn't, reviewing games is not something I care about, but coding is) then I would want this to be a feature.

The final page of this project is the about section. There isn't much to talk about here. This is just a centered-div with a logo and a main article with an aside. Clicking on the "Business Email" button opens up an email client to send an email. The coolest part of this page is the background which was the same image as the homepage, but it is converted to an SVG.

Because Tailwind is mobile first, I built the webpage as a mobile-first webpage. I also built this to b a Progressive Web App so that people could add it to their phone like an app.

# The Future of This Project

Stockpile Gaming is largely abandoned. The logo that I made for it has been re-used for my other social media accounts, and I haven't done any updates to the website or written anything for it since. I might re-write the website to have a stronger portfolio but I think that I have more interesting projects to work on at this time.

This project is possibly the most important project on my portfolio because it represented a massive leap in my abilities and problem solving. Some of the aspects of this project live on in all of my other projects and it made me decide to use React instead of Angular or Vue, which I was also experimenting with at the time.
